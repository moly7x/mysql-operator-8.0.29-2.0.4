# This sample creates a simple InnoDB Cluster. It's similar to sample-cluster.yaml
# but sets additional configuration variables for the MySQL Server.
# These MySQL settings are deployed onto the MySQL Server Pods upon their creation.
# These MySQL settings are not validated by the operator before deploying;
# this example exists to show YAML formatting for the mycnf setting.
